"00000.svg": "Hi! I'm meniere's boy.  I have meniere's disease, it's only in my right ear - and I like writing in cursive.  Diagnosed June 2021."
"00100.svg": "Meniere's Disease was invented (stricken) first described by the french physician Prosper Meniere in 1861.  (inside heart bubble) Je t'adore.  (face of prosper meniere w/ speech bubbles) Mon Dieu! Le ear is Le Sad :("
"00200.svg": "No one knows what causes Meniere's Disease.  The symptoms are caused by a buildup of fluid (aka endolymph) in the internal ear. [labeled drawing of the inner ear]"
"00300.svg": "Symptoms include: painful pressure, light-headedness and dizzyness, tinnitus (ringing) [a drawing of a cartoon demon screaming into meniere's boy's ear] my friend, screaming ear demon"
"00400.svg": "(symptoms list continues) Also: headaches, [drawing of brain with cloud over it] brain fog (hard to focus on stuff), hearing loss... but also loudness sensitivity."
"00500.svg": "(symptoms list continues) But wait! There's more: [drawing of meniere's boy inside spiral with spirals for eyes] Crippling attacks of vertigo which can last for minutes or hours.  Fortunately these are very rare for Meniere's Boy"
"00600.svg": "[drawing of prosper meniere with goofy glasses looking confusedly at a wacky graph with 'le time' on the x axis and 'le symptoms' on the y axis] Symptoms can fluctuate a lot daily and hourly, not all symptoms happen together."
"00700.svg": "There isn't much in the way of treatments, [drawing of meniere's boy taking pills] you can a diuretic so that your inner ear retains less fluid (hopefully) (it might work), [drawing of meiniere's boy with a syringe going into his ear] you can get steroids injected into your middle ear (not as bad as it sounds) (it might work)"
"00800.svg": "The main thing you can do to control the symptoms is to eat a low sodium diet.  [drawing of salt and pepper shaker with salt shaker crossed out] Pepper, my only friend [drawing of meniere's boy with thought bubble] audieu, bon ami. [drawing of takeout container, crossed out] [drawing of pizza box, crossed out] [drawing of deli, crossed out]"
"00900.svg": "Eating low sodium is pretty doable but requires a lot of changes. [drawing of meniere's boy with speech bubble] Just say Na (Na as in the chemical symbol for sodium).  I used to eat maybe 4000-6000mg of sodium on a normal day.  Now I try to stay around 1500/day [drawing of scale with a lot of salt on one side and very little on the other.
