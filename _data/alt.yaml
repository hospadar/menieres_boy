"00000": "Hi! I'm meniere's boy.  I have meniere's disease, it's only in my right ear - and I like writing in cursive.  Diagnosed June 2021."
"00100": "Meniere's Disease was invented (stricken) first described by the french physician Prosper Meniere in 1861.  (inside heart bubble) Je t'adore.  (face of prosper meniere w/ speech bubbles) Mon Dieu! Le ear is Le Sad :("
"00200": "No one knows what causes Meniere's Disease.  The symptoms are caused by a buildup of fluid (aka endolymph) in the internal ear. [labeled drawing of the inner ear]"
"00300": "Symptoms include: painful pressure, light-headedness and dizzyness, tinnitus (ringing) [a drawing of a cartoon demon screaming into meniere's boy's ear] my friend, screaming ear demon"
"00400": "(symptoms list continues) Also: headaches, [drawing of brain with cloud over it] brain fog (hard to focus on stuff), hearing loss... but also loudness sensitivity."
"00500": "(symptoms list continues) But wait! There's more: [drawing of meniere's boy inside spiral with spirals for eyes] Crippling attacks of vertigo which can last for minutes or hours.  Fortunately these are very rare for Meniere's Boy"
"00600": "[drawing of prosper meniere with goofy glasses looking confusedly at a wacky graph with 'le time' on the x axis and 'le symptoms' on the y axis] Symptoms can fluctuate a lot daily and hourly, not all symptoms happen together."
"00700": "There isn't much in the way of treatments, [drawing of meniere's boy taking pills] you can a diuretic so that your inner ear retains less fluid (hopefully) (it might work), [drawing of meiniere's boy with a syringe going into his ear] you can get steroids injected into your middle ear (not as bad as it sounds) (it might work)"
"00800": "The main thing you can do to control the symptoms is to eat a low sodium diet.  [drawing of salt and pepper shaker with salt shaker crossed out] Pepper, my only friend [drawing of meniere's boy with thought bubble] audieu, bon ami. [drawing of takeout container, crossed out] [drawing of pizza box, crossed out] [drawing of deli, crossed out]"
"00900": "Eating low sodium is pretty doable but requires a lot of changes. [drawing of meniere's boy with speech bubble] Just say Na (Na as in the chemical symbol for sodium).  I used to eat maybe 4000-6000mg of sodium on a normal day.  Now I try to stay around 1500/day [drawing of scale with a lot of salt on one side and very little on the other. [drawing of nutrition facts label from food package] Nutrition facts / Serving Size: less than you think / Calories - meh / Carbs - who cares / Protein - ??? / Sodium 10,000% / Ingredients: Salt, more salt"
"00100": "Some stuff has so much sodium that I don't eat it at all (fish & soy sauce, cured/deli meat, most cheeses, olives, most pickled things, pizza and basically all prepared/take-out/restaurant food) [cute drawings of aforementioned foods].  Other stuff is Ok, but I just can't have as much - [drawing of bread] ~150mg/slice (I can eat 1/meal), [drawing of smiley face with fried eggs for eyes, tongue sticking out playfully] 75mg/egg (yolk has almost no sodium), [drawing of hen] ~65mg/4oz (most meat is similar unless brined)"
"01100": "Some foods that have little/no sodium and are easy to find: [each food accompanied by a little drawing of that food] frosted mini-wheats, fruits & veggies, unsalted chips [chip bag has tiny logo featuring drawing of Prosper Menière], pasta & rice, terrestrial meat (seafood sometimes), dried fruit, nuts (unsalted), maybe granola, eggs!  Some cheeses are ok like swiss (if < 60mg/oz), cream cheese (if < 100mg/oz), fresh moz (depends on how it's prepared)"
"01200": "Cooking & Meal Planning: [drawing of meniere's boy with mouth wide open with egg, lettuce leaf, and bread slice flying into his mouth] Meniere's boy tries to keep each meal to 200-400g of sodium.  Although 1500mg/day is the goal, it's important to avoid big spikes of sodium [drawing of a graph with time on the x axis and sodium on the y axis showing a big spike, next to graph Prosper Menière exclaims 'le bad']"
"01300": "Choosing food for meniere's boy: Ok snack foods: < 60mg/serving [drawing of snack food bag labeled 'lightly salted'], Great snack foods: < 10mg/serving [drawing of snack food box labeld 'unsalted' with an outline of michigan].  You _have to_ check the nutrition facts [the words 'nutrition facts are depicted inside a nutrition label.  The 'serving size' for the nutrition label says 'less than you think'] for every brand of food.  Pay attention to serving size!"
"01400": "Salt Substitute (KCl).  Potassium Chloride: aka NoSalt, potassium salt, the artist formerly known as salt.  Available most places, this salt alternative has no sodium.  It can be used as a 1:1 replacement for regular salt.  Can have a funny aftertaste.  Great for baking.  Good to have on hand for meniere's boy. [drawing of a small cardboard tube package of NoSalt.  The label on the package is a drawing of the musical artist Prince.  The label has a small kosher symbol (Ⓚ) next to a similar small rendering of the prince symbol inside a circle]."
